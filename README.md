# RadioAtlas
Listen to thousands of live radio stations local to their regions. Discover local music, talks, news and thoughts by simply spinning the map to tune-in.  Connect with distant cultures .... or even reconnect back with your hometown. Discover what sounds familiar... or foreign. Discover what sounds like home away from home.  Originally inspired by the "Radio Garden" website, this App takes it up a notch with a clean database of thousands of active terrestrial and internet radio stations. We give you a number of features that make serendipitous discovery easy and enjoyable:   - Get information about the playing stream (song, artist, etc.) whenever available - Add stations to your favorites - "Rewind" and go back to a previously visited station - Tap the "World" button and sit back to listen to 20 second clips of live radio across the world. When you hear something you like, simply tap once to continue listening.  - Free, no ads, and no need to register/login.
